## 🎯 Copy This Prompt

Open a **new Cursor conversation** and copy-paste the contents of:
**`docs/NEXT-CONVERSATION-PROMPT.md`**

That file contains everything the next agent needs to know!

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

1. ✅ **RLS 403 Errors** - All policies in place, org created, you're owner
2. ✅ **Business Insights in Discuss** - Code updated, should work now
3. ✅ **Composer Org Selection** - Selector added for multi-org users

## 📋 Git Sync (For Lovable Projects)

Since this is a **Lovable project**, git may be auto-managed. To check:

1. **If git exists locally:**
   ```bash
   git status
   git branch -a
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Check GitHub:**
   - Go to your GitHub repo
   - Check "Branches" tab for unmerged branches
   - Check "Pull Requests" tab for open PRs
   - Merge/close as needed

3. **Lovable auto-sync:**
   - Changes via Lovable auto-commit
   - Check Lovable dashboard for sync status

## 🧪 Quick Test
