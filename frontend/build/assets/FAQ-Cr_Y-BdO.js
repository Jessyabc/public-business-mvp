We believe in creating a distraction-free environment where substantive content and meaningful connections take priority over advertising revenue."},{question:"What's the difference between Utility, Involvement, and T-score?",answer:"T-score tracks your intellectual contributions through brainstorms and idea development for Public Members. Utility Score measures how valuable business content is to the community. Involvement Score reflects engagement with business reports and white papers."},{question:"Can I switch between Public and Business modes?",answer:"Yes, you can toggle between Public and Business modes using the mode switcher. Public mode focuses on brainstorms and community engagement, while Business mode emphasizes professional content, reports, and company insights."}]},{category:"Content & Publishing",questions:[{question:"How are Business Reports and White Papers different?",answer:"White Papers are comprehensive research documents with annotations and version control. Business Reports are typically shorter, focus on company updates, financial information, or strategic insights. Both are professional-grade content but serve different purposes."},{question:"Can I publish content without being a Business Member?",answer:"Public Members can create brainstorms and participate in idea development. Only Business Members can publish white papers and official business reports. However, Public Members can comment, annotate, and engage with all published content."},{question:"How do annotations work on white papers?",answer:"Annotations allow readers to add comments, questions, or insights directly to specific sections of white papers. Authors can respond to annotations, creating collaborative discussions around the content. All annotations are public and contribute to the overall value of the publication."}]},{category:"Membership & Access",questions:[{question:"Do I need a membership to read reports?",answer:"Basic access to most content is free. Premium memberships (coming soon) will provide enhanced access to exclusive reports, advanced features, and priority support. Some high-value business reports may require premium access."},{question:"How do I become a Business Member?",answer:"Apply through our Business Member application process. We review applications based on company legitimacy, content quality potential, and alignment with our professional community standards. Not all applications are automatically approved."},{question:"What happens to my data if I cancel my account?",answer:"You can download your data at any time. Published content remains on the platform (as it may be referenced by others), but your personal information is deleted according to our privacy policy. You can request complete content removal if needed."}]},{category:"Community & Recognition",questions:[{question:"Where can I see the Most Influential boards?",answer:"Most Influential boards are accessible from the main navigation and showcase top-performing Public Members (by T-score) and Business Members (by Utility and Involvement scores). These boards update regularly based on community engagement and content quality."},{question:"How is the T-score calculated?",answer:"T-score reflects the quality and impact of your brainstorm contributions. It considers factors like idea originality, engagement from other members, branching frequency, and long-term discussion value. Higher-quality, more thought-provoking contributions score higher."},{question:"Can I collaborate with Business Members?",answer:"Absolutely! Public Members can engage with Business Member content through annotations, brainstorm extensions, and direct networking features (available with premium membership). This cross-pollination of ideas is core to our platform."}]},{category:"Technical & Privacy",questions:[{question:"How do you protect my privacy?",answer:"We use industry-standard encryption, never sell user data, and provide granular privacy controls. Your intellectual property remains yours. We're transparent about data usage and provide easy export/deletion options."},{question:"Is there a mobile app?",answer:"Our web platform is fully responsive and works excellently on mobile devices.
